Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
 Belgium became definitely top1 after 100000 simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
after 100000 simulations the predictions became stable
